## How things actually are working in under the hoodü§î ?

- **Step - 1:** At initial user starts sending customer details such as:
  - Customer Name
  - Phone Number
  - Items list ( Item Name, Quantity, Price of each )
  - Shipping cost
- This user entered message will be forwarded to Backend Server which has been attached as a **WebHook** for Telegram-bot-api.
- **Step - 2:** The response message will be forwarded to **Gemini-API** to extract & format into a preferred **JSON format**, however the user types the message of customer details. And sends back the json to Webhook server.
- **Step - 3:** Now this json will be attached as a **query parameter to Next.js Frontend URL**. And this full URL will be passed to Puppeteer.
- **Step - 4:** The Puppeteer will lauch the headless browser via **@sparticuz/chromium - a precompiled chromium binary**. And then Puppeteer will take screen shot and return that screenshot to the user.

That's it.‚ú®
